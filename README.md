# Spotted Lanternfly

## Overview
Observational data was retrieved from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). iNaturalist is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that creates a citizen science platform where users contribute biodiversity observations by photograph or sound recording. Observations may include the complete Linnaean classification, GPS locations, and dates. Additional parameters include life stages and type of evidence of life. The website and app contain crowd-sourced data to receive help with species identifications, collaborate with other citizen scientists for a common purpose, or access additional observational data collected by iNaturalist users for ecological or biological research.

**Data Collection**: The data was subsetted for only Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) observations. Data was downloaded as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

## Method
Python with pandas was used to clean the data.

- The dataset was cleaned to remove observations not within the United States.
- Observations were filtered for “Research Grade” observations, which are confirmed by an identifier or subject matter expert.
- The `.drop` function from pandas removed the columns `uuid`, `private_latitude`, and `private_longitude`.
- The following column names were adjusted using the `rename` function:
  - `place_town_name` to `town`
  - `place_county_name` to `county`
  - `place_state_name` to `state`
  - `place_country_name` to `country`
- A new data frame was created and named `lanternfly1`. The cleaned data was then saved to an updated CSV file named `cleaned_lanternfly.csv`.
